web-components-intro
====================

A step-by-step introduction to coding web components, intended for use during a presentation.


Installation
============

Run `npm install` to pull down the necessary dependencies.


Usage
=====

Run `grunt start` to begin. It will check out the commit for the first step, start a web server, and navigate to it in a new tab in your browser. Press enter in the terminal when you are ready to move to the next step.

Use a side-by-side diffing tool (like SmartGit) to show code changes from step to step.
